I'm a Research Scientist on the [Seed/Doubao](https://team.doubao.com/en/) team at [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/about?lang=en)/[ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/), focusing on [speech synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis). I completed my M.S. in Computer Science at [Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/).

My research interests include deep generative modeling, self-supervised representation and transfer learning, zero-shot learning, and knowledge distillation. I'm especially interested in neural end-to-end learning for audio and natural language processing tasks.
